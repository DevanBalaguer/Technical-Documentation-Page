<header><h1>So You Fired Your Contractor</h1></header>
  <p>We’ve all heard the horror stories. “I paid him and then I never saw him again… It’s been 4 months and nothing has been done…They tell me they’ll be there and then no one comes!”  There are so many red flags, nightmare situations, and warnings posted all over the internet but we think <i>Oh, that’ll never actually happen to me though.</i>… and then it does.</p>
  <p>So, you’ve had enough of the run-around and you’ve made the decision. You fire your contractor. Now what?  Maybe you’re 5 months deep in a kitchen renovation that was supposed to take 5 weeks.  You’re walls are torn open and there is materials and trash everywhere.  Where do you even start? </p>

  <header><h1>Can I Get My Money Back?</h1></header>
  <p>You’ve already paid your ex-contractor way too much money and have gotten a demolished project in return.  It’s overwhelming. And frustrating. And anyone you talk to about it just nods their head as if they’ve seen it a thousand times. How can this just be okay?</p>
  <p>The blunt answer: it’s not. But the laws in place all favor the business-owner, not the home-owner.  So, can you get your money back? It is highly unlikely. However, a few steps that are available for you are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Hound that S.O.B:</b> As much as you probably want to cuss them out and scream at the top of your lungs this will not get you anything from them.  Lay out the facts, be curtious and respectful and come to an agreement on a refund price and date. Then stay on them. They didn't come up with the money on your scheduled date? Revise with a payment plan. Yes, it sucks to cater to someone who has screwed you over. But there is nothing else in place that can enforce them to pay you back. </li>
    <li><b>File a small claims suit:</b>  In any suit there are essential two actions- one – (1) was someone at fault- and (2) what are the damages.  Typically the contractor claims he performed  a portion of the work and is entitled to be paid for what he did (even if done poorly).  Even if you win a law suit, and the judge finds that there are damages and you are entitled to a refund or  money (because what they did will need money to fix) , then you have to “enforce” the judgement- go after his assets, which is another action.   Not an easy task, often these folks are judgement proof, have no assets or hide the assets, operate under an LLC that is undercapitalized or if judgements are high enough declare bankruptcy.    Not to say you can’t recover but it can be expensive and no guarantee you will get the money back . </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You’ve picked yourself up, dusted off, and are ready to get this project done! But what first?</p>
  <p>Subcontractors to hire:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do you need framing?</b> Hire a carpenter: <code>They're the person who will shape the structure that defines the spaces. They builds the framework that will be the matrix for the electrical wiring, piping, vents, phone lines, and insulation.</code> </li>
    <li><b>Do you need water?</b> Hire a plumber: <code>They can move your water lines, add new plumbing, move your gas lines, and even install your water fixtures.</code></li>
    <li><b>Do you need electricity?</b> Hire an electrician: <code>They will install your outlets, lighting, and replace any old wiring.</code></li>
    <li><b>Do you need heat or AC?</b> Hire an HVAC Contractor: <code>They will relocate HVAC ducts, install or replace any old HVAC or AC systems.</code></li>
    <li><b>Do you need drywall?</b> Hire an Drywaller: <code>They will hang the drywall, seal it, and patch any holes made by the other contractors you've hired. They can even skim coat any textured walls or ceilings you'd rather have smooth.</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You've been burned. You thought you hired someone you could rely on. So how can you trust letting another person into your home and giving them money in hopes that they'll deliver on what you've agreed upon?</p>
  <p>Tips for hiring good people:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Recommendations:</b> from friends, neighbors, family, or co-workers.  But only hire someone if the person you got the recommendation from has used them recently. </li>
    <li><b>Realestate Investor Groups:</b> Find realestate investors in your city.  They need work done fast, well, and cheap, so they will know the best people to hire for your project.</li>
    <li><b>Multiple Quotes:</b> I know you want to get things done ASAP and the thought of taking the time to have multiple people over to quote your project makes you sick to your stomach.  However, getting at least three quotes for any project is a good rule.  You'll see the crazy difference in pricing and find who's schedule works best with yours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Timelines and Scheduling<h2>
  <p>It's time to steel yourself for the frustration of scheduling. Most people that you hire will be booking weeks out.</p>
  <p>Good planning on your part and constant communication with the vari­ous subs are both essential.</p>
  <h2> The Domino effect</h2>
  <p>Every portion of a project has a million other things that are affected.  Just be aware that even the tiniest change or addition can be a big detriment to your timeline and wallet.</p>
  <h2>It's okay to hire a new contractor<h2>
    <p>It's scary to think about handing over your project to someone else again. But being your own contractor is hard work, physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p>
    <p>If you do decide to hire a new contractor, follow these guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get at least three quotes from different contractors.</li>
      <li>Have an end date written in the contract.</li>
      <li>Do not pay any money until they have hit the milestones listed in your contract and it is done to your liking.</li>
      <li>Stress the need for constant communication.</li>
      <li> Most people are very sympathetic to your situation. Make sure they know what happened. Everyone loves to play the hero.</li>
    </ol>
